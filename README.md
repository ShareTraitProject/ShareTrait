# About ShareTrait
 
ShareTrait is a project funded by the Dutch Research Council [NWO](https://www.nwo.nl/en) through the [Open Science Fund](https://www.nwo.nl/en/researchprogrammes/open-science/open-science-fund) initiative.

## Summary of ShareTrait

More and more data are being collected on species traits, as a means to understand how species respond and interact with their environment. Despite these
efforts, effective integration of such data is hampered by inadequate standardization and insufficient sharing of metadata. **This project will streamline the
collection, synthesis and reuse of data on key species traits (metabolic rate, development and fecundity)**. By developing pipelines for data reformatting and standardization, we will enable individual researchers to easily contribute their data to our new database, allowing the research community to tap into the
wealth of existing data and achieve a synthesis.

## Contributing new data to ShareTrait
To contribute data on metabolic rates, fecundity or development of ectotherms, please contact us (email: felixpleiva@gmail.com). We are actualy working in generating  spreadsheet-type templates (.csv; .xls) in conjunction with a file describing the metadata. It will facilitate contributors with the data entry process.
